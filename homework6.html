  <h1>Homework 6 – VECTOR EMOTIVE EYE</h1>
 <img src="imagehw6/eye.png" width="50%" alt="eye">

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>I chose a palette of yellow and blue because of their strong visual contrast. Yellow often suggests alertness, intensity, or even anxiety, while blue can feel cold, distant, or uneasy. Together, these complementary colors create visual tension rather than harmony. The high contrast between the colors draws the viewer’s attention immediately to the center of the compositio.

The main shapes of the piece are the circular form of the eye and the spiral within it. The spiral inside represents confusion, mental overload, and overstimulation. Spirals naturally suggest motion and lack of control, and the one inside the eye reinforces the idea that the viewer is trapped in a cycle of constant visual input. 

 I also used rough, uneven lines around the eye to create a sense of instability, avoiding clean or perfectly smooth edges. The variation in line weight adds energy and reinforces the feeling of unease.

I made the eye large and centered so that it takes up most of the artboard. There is little negative space, which further contributes to the feeling of overstimulation. The final image was exported as a PNG and posted.</p>
