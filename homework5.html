  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>TIn Adobe Illustrator, I created the vector bubbles rising above the traffic sign and the bar crossing the woman’s eyes to add layered meaning to my image.</p>
 <p>The repeated words “SCREAM” echo like as people panic and let their fustrations out regarding climate change.</p>
