  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>
   I chose to focus on VTuber viewership habits,  looking at which platforms audiences use to watch VTubers and where those audiences are located geographically. This topic was of personal interest to me because VTubers exis tas entertainment, digital culture, and online communities, and their global reach makes them a strong subject for data visualization. I gathered data using publicly available statistics then organized the information into clear numerical values.
  </p>

  <p>
   Two key findings stood out: YouTube is the dominant platform for VTuber content consumption, and Japan overwhelmingly represents the largest share of the audience.  used a bar graph to compare platforms and a pie chart to represent audience country distribution.

  <p>
    Using Adobe Illustrator, I created a 1920 x 1080 artboard and laid out the design with grids and guides. I used Illustrator’s Graph Tools to generate the charts, then customized them by adjusting colors, labels, and spacing. I enhanced the visualization with icons, such as the Twitch and YouTube logos. The use of a blurred illustrated background helped contextualize the data within VTuber culture.
  </p>

  <p>
 Japan’s dominance is emphasized through bold color, particularly in the pie chart, where its large percentage immediately draws the viewer’s attention.  Overall, this project helped me understand how design choices can shape how data is interpreted.
