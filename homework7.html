  <h1>Homework 7 – Illustrated Environment (</h1>

  <h2>Original Photograph</h2>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    I chose an interior environment as the basis for my Illustrator transformation. I was drawn to this space because of its  geometric structure and sense of depth. The original photograph contained clean lines, flat surfaces, and clear divisions between walls, and floor. This made it easier to translate the environment into a stylized illustration.
  </p>

  <p>
    I imported the photograph into Adobe Illustrator and placed it on its own locked layer to use as a template. From there, I rebuilt the environment entirely with vector shapes. I  separated the composition into background, middle ground, and foreground layers. Organizing the illustration this way helped keep the composition clean.
  </p>

  <p>
My color palette was three tones drawn from a triadic color scheme created using Adobe Color CC. I selected cool blue toons. 
  </p>

  <p>
The final illustration simplifies the original photograph while preserving its sense of depth and scale. By reducing the environment to flat shapes and a limited color palette, the image feels more abstract and intentiona. The final piece was exported as a PNG and presented alongside the original photograph to  show the transformation from raster image to vector illustration.
