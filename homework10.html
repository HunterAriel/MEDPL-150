       <h2>Reflection</h2>
   <p>
     For this assignment, I created a story centered around a hamster named Mochi. I was able to create a lighthearted story that has exploration, curiosity, and consequence.

The planning and mapping stage was the first step in this project. I mapped out the story paths to ensure that the narrative included multiple branching choices and at least three distinct endings, with more than one way to reach each ending. Each decision point lets you guide Mochi’s adventure, reinforcing the interactive nature of the story.

The cute visual elements played an important role in shaping the tone and mood of the narrative. I drew images that were used to support the text.

From a technical standpoint, this project strengthened my understanding of HTML structure, relative file paths, and hyperlink navigation. Each page is an individual scene, connected through links that allows you to move between different story branches. Ensuring that all links worked correctly and that images displayed properly required careful organization of folders and consistent file naming. 

You can shape Mochi’s adventure through your choices!
