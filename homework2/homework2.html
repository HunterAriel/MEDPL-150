  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>This photo was part of my photo theme on “signs.” I thought the handwritten label on the door was kind of cute in its simplicity. But after darkening the image in Photoshop by lowering the brightness, deepening the shadows, and slightly boosting the contrast, it took on an unexpected tone. What started as a casual shot suddenly looked eerie and unsettling!</p>
