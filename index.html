<p>My work starts with a phone camera, but it doesn’t stop there. I take photographs of street corners, alleyways, grass fields and transform distort, bend, and reimagine reality. By me modifying these images, these moments, I create art that was once familiar but now not. I let out a call to step beyond what is seen and into a new world.

I love the idea of escaping; Not as a denial of reality though, but that I can reshape it. The world can be dull, depressing, and predictable; With my art, I want to tear through that and reveal a sense of wonder. Influenced by anime and manga that create art for stories from real places, I want to make life itself appear more whimsical and alive, reminding thoughts who see my art that even the most ordinary places can be molded into something new. 

Digital manipulation is like getting a new set of eyes that can see what ordinary people cannot. Inspired by contemporary artists such as @segu_ishida and @ikuta41, I use layering, distortion, and color to blur the line between fiction and reality. In doing so, I create images that offer new lenses, an escape.

My art is provides a touch of magic for the ordinary. By me altering reality through photography and digital art, I want to remind both myself and thoughts who view my art that life is never as flat as it seems. There is more; It is textured, layered, and waiting to be seen differently.
