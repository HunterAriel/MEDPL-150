  <h1>Homework 8 – GIF 2: Cut Up Cinema<</h1>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
I created an animated cat using Photoshop’s Puppet Warp tool. I selected a cat photographed against a high-contrast background to ensure clean edges.
</p>

<p>
I began by isolating the cat from the background using selection tools and masking techniques in Photoshop. I then duplicated the cat across multiple layers, with each layer representing a different frame of the animation. 
</p>

<p>
To animate the cat, I used the Puppet Warp tool to make subtle but noticeable changes in posture and movement across frames. By placing pins on the body, I was able to bend and reposition the cats limbs. Each duplicated layer was warped slightly differently, creating the illusion of motion! 
</p>

<p>
After creating multiple warped frames, and built a frame animation. Each frame was a different warped layer, allowing the cat to shift positions as the GIF plays.
