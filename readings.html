  <h2>Reading: Susan Sontag's *On Photography*</h2>

  <p>
    Chapter 1, In Plato’s Cave by Susan Sontag made me think about how photography shapes not only our memories but also the way we experience life. Sontag writes that humankind lingers in Plato’s cave, “still reveling, its age-old habit, in mere images of the truth” (p.1). She explains that photographs give us a new way of seeing, yet at the same time they can trap us in images instead of real moments. Later, she even compares cameras to weapons, arguing that while they don’t kill, taking a photograph can still feel like a kind of violation, turning people into objects that can be symbolically possessed.

    Sontag talks about how photographs get reduced, cropped, retouched, and repackaged, and how those new images end up in albums, on walls, or in books. What really stood out to me is the thought that photos don’t stay pure; always changed or placed in some kind of frame that makes us look at them in a certain way. It made me reflect on how I edit pictures on my phone before posting them, or how over editing/filters on social media change the actual “truth” of an image. Sontag continues on to say that books have been the most influential way to organize photos because they make fragile images last longer. That connected with me because I think about how often my own digital photos got lost or deleted, kind of like when Myspace wiped out most of its photos, including ones I’ll never be able to get back. While the printed ones from my childhood actually survived this long. We really rely on packaging and presentation to give photographs meaning, and how just like that they can disappear without it.

    Sontag gives us backround on how photography shifted from being a rare, expensive act in the 1840s to something nearly everyone does, comparing it to things like dancing or sex. She mentions that photography isn’t consistently practiced as “art” but more as a social ritual, a way to fight off anxiety or to feel fill that need to always be connected. I do see that in my own life, taking pictures doesn’t always feel creative, more of a necessity, like proof that I was there. She continues to talk about family photography as a ceremony, like an obligation. She even states not photographing your kids can look like neglect, which I never thought about until reading that. It makes sense when nowadays parents are expected to document every milestone. This made me reflect on the photos in my family albums aren’t just memories, they’re symbols that we even cared enough to capture this very moment. It really shows how photography has become less about art and more about developing a record of belonging.

    Sontag touches on how photography is linked to work culture and anxiety, specifically in places like Germany, Japan, and America, where people struggle to relax on vacation. She says taking pictures gives people something to do, almost like turning fun into another kind of “work.” I one hundred percent related to that because even when I go on trips, I feel the urge to take photos, as if the vacation didn’t count unless I can post about it, even though these images most likely stick in peoples minds long. She also compares American tourists of the 1950s and 60s with Japanese tourists of the 1970s, pointing out how both became stereotypes of over photographing. Also during that time, the famous 1972 Vietnam War photograph of the young girl burned by napalm was taken. It stirred outrage in ways that hours of television coverage could not. I found this really important and powerful because it shows how one image can actually stick in people’s minds and change public opinion.

    I saw myself in her descriptions of people using photos to hold tight to memories, to connect with family, and even to document suffering. I rely on photos to preserve my life, but maybe sometimes I need to put down the camera and actually live it.

    <h3>Reading: With ‘AI Slop’ Distorting Our Reality, the World Is Sleepwalking into Disaster by Nesrine Malik</h3>
In Nesrine Malik’s article “With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster,” she alerts us that generative artificial intelligence (AI) has created digital pollution. Malik calls this stuff “AI slop,” characterizing it as the stream of cheaply produced, low-quality, and more often than not, misleading images. She states that it is not only bad art or memes, it’s fake images that reshape our reality and morality.
Malik states there are harmless pictures of “giant balls of cats”, and then there’s disturbing, hypersexualized, or politically manipulative content. AI-generated pictures don’t just peacefully coexist with real images; they distort, making it difficult for consumers to know what is authentic. 
She goes on to give examples of how AI slop has been weaponized politically. AI-generated images have been used to create fake scenarios that glorify leaders such as Donald Trump or demonize marginalized groups. Even the White House has participated in trends where AI-generated visuals were shared for engagement, such as images in Studio Ghibli style. 
Malik discusses how these images have even entered networks like WhatsApp, where misinformation often spreads. On WhatsApp, there is no comment sections to debunk or give context. People blindly trust the messages sent by friends or family, which makes the misinformation even harder to sort through. Malik’s provided a personal example of her elderly relative who believes fake AI war footage about Sudan.
Malik brings up Professor Roland Meyer, who argues that “generative AI is structurally conservative, even nostalgic.”  AI art often reproduces outdated ideals like “trad wife” aesthetics, submissive women, and white nuclear families under the disguise of nostalgia. What may look harmless at first glance is actually coded reinforcement of racist and patriarchal hierarchies. 
So much of AI on social media is just content farming slop to feed algorithms. Malik quotes journalist Max Read, who stated that Facebook rewards “highly engaging content,” regardless of whether it is AI junk or human created. 
Malik paints a gloomy picture of a society overwhelmed by digital noise. Exposure to never-ending AI images continues to numbs us; even real photos of war, injustice, or tragedy start to feel unreal. Real world suffering is consumed like entertainment. I couldn’t agree more with Malik’s conclusion that humanity is “sleepwalking into disaster.” As a Media Major student, I oftentimes think about how technology changes storytelling, but this piece made me think about how it changes perception itself. If everything is/becomes content, then nothing feels meaningful.
This article honestly left me feeling a bit uneasy, because it made me question my own media habits. How I scrolled past a post made via AI and think it’s real? It’s scary how easy it is to feel you are pretty informed while actually being manipulated by algorithms. As someone studying media, I feel both a responsibility yet powerless at the same time. We’re supposed to tell stories and seek truth, but how do we do that when truth itself is constantly being rewritten by AI?

  <h3> Reading: My Stolen Future </h3>
  <p> “My Stolen Future” uses illustration, photography, and text to convey the emotional, political, and social burden of sexual violence against schoolgirls in Sierra Leone. The story, which relies on illustrations, has scenes of assault, fear, and vulnerability. Visual storytelling provides a look into the story in ways that standard journalism or photography alone could not reach. Illustrations can convey the intensity of Heela’s experience without exposing her body, identity, or the exact details of her assault. The art serves as a respectful barrier between the viewer and the survivor.

When Heela is cornered by the older boy who assaults her, the illustration uses shadow and body language to express threat rather than explicit imagery. A photograph here would not only be unethical but impossible to obtain. The graphic form also allows the creators to control pacing. Scenes feel more intimate because the artist chooses exactly what the reader sees: the angle, the color palette, even the background students who casually continue their normal, everyday lives as Heela’s future collapses. Photography often captures reality as it is, but illustration captures how it feels. In this story, you can clearly see that feelings matter just as much as facts.

Illustration outlines emotion, photography shows reality. The page of the counselor interacting with Heela bridges the gap between art and actual lived experience. With this, the reader is confronted with the real spaces where survivors go for help. The textures of the wooden table, the fabric of the counselor’s dress, and the natural lighting remind the audience that these centers are very much real; These stories are not hypothetical or metaphorical, they are still happening. 

Just using text might communicate these events as well, but would fail to convey the sensory and emotional texture that illustrations provide. Just using photography would risk exposing survivors or misrepresenting moments that should never ethically be photographed. However, pure illustration would risk separating the reader from the real institutional and cultural settings of the crisis. Together, you get empathy through art, accountability through photography.

Heela’s story is not linear; It is a collection of horrible memories, fears, and hopes. The illustrated moments show us, the readers, the parts of her experience that she must relive internally, the pregnancy and confrontation. Photographs show healing begins. The medium shifts precisely when the emotional tone shifts as well. 

All in all, illustration gives the storytellers the freedom to portray the unsayable. It creates a safe place for visual language for topics that traditional journalism struggles to represent with sensitivity. It furthermore invites readers to imagine, empathize, and internalize the emotional stakes. Photography then steps in to remind the reader that this is indeed not fiction; the crisis is very real, the institutions are very real, and the consequences are also very real.

In “My Stolen Future,” using illustration was not just an aesthetic choice, but also an ethical one. Together with photography, it forms a compassionate and powerful visual story that protects survivors while confronting audiences with this horrible ongoing crisis.
