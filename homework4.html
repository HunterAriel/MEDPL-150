  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>The first image dives into global warming and the downfall of a world drowning in its own neglect. I wanted the people who see this image to feel the panic and anxiety. The woman’s cry embodies all the frustration, fear, and helplessness. The half-submerged traffic sign warns of danger, but it’s too late. Every element, from the cool blueish tones to the distortion of the waves, depicts a suffocating silence. I used Screen and Soft Light blending modes to blend the human skin with the sea’s texture. All the images were sourced from Unsplash, but through layering, tone shifts, and blending, I wanted the viewer to see the world is both screaming and sinking at the same time..</p>
 <p>The second image explores hikikomori culture in Japan. In Japanese, the word for social withdrawal syndrome is hikikomori (引きこもり or ひきこもり). It refers to a person who is a severe shut-in, which is happening to more and more people in Japan. I wanted someone who looks at this image to feel suffocated, like being swallowed by their own thoughts. The overlapping Japanese calligraphy represents the noise of expectations and traditions. I used Multiply and Overlay blending modes to merge the background and figure, letting the colors bleed together like fading memories. The dim green light and rough textures were intentional, I wanted them to echo the loneliness, fear, and strange comfort that come from disappearing inside one's own world.</p>
